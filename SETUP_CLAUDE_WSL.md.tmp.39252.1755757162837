# Setup Claude CLI in WSL2

## Installation Steps

Run these commands in WSL2:

```bash
# 1. Install Claude CLI
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-cli

# OR if that doesn't work, try:
curl -fsSL https://console.anthropic.com/install.sh | sh

# OR manual installation:
wget https://github.com/anthropics/claude-cli/releases/latest/download/claude-linux-x64
chmod +x claude-linux-x64
sudo mv claude-linux-x64 /usr/local/bin/claude
```

## After Installation

1. Authenticate (if needed):
```bash
claude auth login
```

2. Navigate to project:
```bash
cd ~/Projects/NiroAgent/na-agents
```

3. Start Claude:
```bash
claude
```

4. Give the prompt from WSL_PROMPT.md

## Alternative: Use Claude Code directly in WSL

If claude CLI isn't available, you can also use:

```bash
# Option 1: Use npx
npx @anthropic-ai/claude

# Option 2: Use the API directly with curl
# (would need to set up API key)
```

## Simplest Alternative: Continue here

If you can't get Claude CLI in WSL, just tell me:
"Continue working on the agent tasks in the WSL directory at ~/Projects/NiroAgent/na-agents"

And I can work with the files directly from here since WSL filesystem is accessible from Windows at \\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\[username]\Projects\NiroAgent\na-agents
