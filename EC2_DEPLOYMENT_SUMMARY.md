# NA-Agents EC2 Deployment Summary

**Date:** August 21, 2025  
**Target:** Existing EC2 Instance (i-0af59b7036f7b0b77)  
**Status:** Deployment Triggered via GitHub Actions

## 🎯 What Was Accomplished

### 1. EC2 Deployment Scripts Created
- **deploy-to-ec2.sh** - Creates new EC2 infrastructure from scratch
- **deploy-to-existing-ec2.sh** - Deploys to existing EC2 instance
- Both scripts use PM2 for process management and auto-restart

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow Updated
- Modified to deploy TypeScript agents to EC2 instances
- Uses SSM (Systems Manager) to deploy without SSH keys
- Supports environment-specific EC2 instances via variables

### 3. TypeScript Agent Deployment Process
The deployment script will:
1. Stop existing Python agents on the EC2 instance
2. Clone the TypeScript agents repository
3. Install Node.js 18 and dependencies
4. Build TypeScript code
5. Configure PM2 process manager
6. Start all 5 agents (Architect, Developer, DevOps, QA, Manager)
7. Set up health checks and auto-restart
8. Configure CloudWatch logging

## 📋 Deployment Configuration

### EC2 Instance Details
- **Instance ID:** i-0af59b7036f7b0b77
- **Instance Type:** t3.large (as per existing setup)
- **Region:** us-east-1
- **Agents:** 5 TypeScript agents on ports 5001-5005

### Agent Ports
```
Architect Agent: Port 5001
Developer Agent: Port 5002
DevOps Agent:    Port 5003
QA Agent:        Port 5004
Manager Agent:   Port 5005
```

### Process Management (PM2)
- Each agent runs as a separate PM2 process
- Automatic restart on failure
- Memory limit: 1GB per agent
- Logs stored in `/opt/na-agents/logs/`
- Health checks every 5 minutes via cron

## 🚀 Deployment Pipeline

1. **Push to GitHub** → Triggers GitHub Actions workflow
2. **Build & Test** → TypeScript compilation and testing
3. **Security Scan** → Trivy vulnerability scanning
4. **Docker Build** → Container image creation
5. **EC2 Deployment** → SSM commands to update agents
6. **Health Checks** → Verify all agents are responding
7. **DNS Setup** → Configure Route53 records (optional)

## 🔍 How to Monitor Deployment

### GitHub Actions
- **URL:** https://github.com/NiroAgent/na-agents/actions
- Check the latest workflow run for deployment status
- Look for green checkmarks indicating successful steps

### Once Deployed
The EC2 instance will have:
- TypeScript agents running on ports 5001-5005
- PM2 managing all agent processes
- Health checks via `/health` endpoints
- Logs in `/opt/na-agents/logs/`

### Testing Connectivity
Once the EC2 public IP is known:
```bash
# Test each agent
curl http://[EC2-IP]:5001/health  # Architect
curl http://[EC2-IP]:5002/health  # Developer
curl http://[EC2-IP]:5003/health  # DevOps
curl http://[EC2-IP]:5004/health  # QA
curl http://[EC2-IP]:5005/health  # Manager
```

### SSH Access (if needed)
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/na-agents-key.pem ec2-user@[EC2-IP]

# Once connected:
pm2 status          # View agent status
pm2 logs            # View all logs
pm2 restart all     # Restart all agents
```

## 📊 Expected Outcome

After successful deployment:
1. All 5 TypeScript agents running on EC2
2. Agents accessible via HTTP on their respective ports
3. Dashboard can connect to agents via EC2 IP
4. PM2 ensures agents stay running
5. Health checks monitor agent status

## 🔧 Configuration Files Created

### PM2 Ecosystem Config
- Located at `/opt/na-agents/ecosystem.config.js`
- Defines all 5 agents with their configurations
- Includes environment variables and logging

### Environment File
- Located at `/opt/na-agents/.env`
- Contains:
  - NODE_ENV=production
  - Dashboard URL
  - AWS region
  - API keys (loaded from Secrets Manager)

### Health Check Script
- Located at `/opt/na-agents/health-check.sh`
- Runs every 5 minutes via cron
- Restarts failed agents automatically

## 💰 Cost Optimization

Using the existing EC2 instance (t3.large):
- **Cost:** ~$60/month (already running)
- **No additional cost** for TypeScript agents
- Replaces Python agents on same instance
- More efficient than ECS Fargate for this use case

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Monitor GitHub Actions** for deployment completion
2. **Get EC2 public IP** once deployment succeeds
3. **Update dashboard** with EC2 IP address
4. **Test all agents** via health endpoints
5. **Run regression tests** against deployed agents
6. **Configure DNS** if using domain names

## 📝 Important Notes

- TypeScript agents replace Python agents on same EC2 instance
- No additional infrastructure costs
- PM2 ensures high availability with auto-restart
- Logs available via CloudWatch and local files
- SSM eliminates need for SSH key management

## 🎉 Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow completes without errors
- [ ] All 5 agents respond to health checks
- [ ] PM2 shows all processes as "online"
- [ ] Dashboard can connect to agents
- [ ] Regression tests pass
