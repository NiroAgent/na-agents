# NA-Agents System Documentation and Progress

## Current Agent Working on This Project
Claude is currently converting the na-agents system from Python to TypeScript and setting up the complete multi-agent infrastructure.

## Project Overview
The NA-Agents system is a multi-agent AI system designed to work together to handle various software development tasks. The agents communicate through a dashboard and can receive instructions from multiple sources including GitHub, voice, chat, and web interfaces.

## Agent Types
1. **Architect Agent** - Designs system architecture and creates technical specifications
2. **Developer Agent** - Generates production code from specifications  
3. **DevOps Agent** - Handles deployment, CI/CD, and infrastructure
4. **QA Agent** - Performs testing and quality assurance
5. **Manager Agent** - Coordinates and oversees all agents

## Key Requirements
- Agents must work locally in Docker and on AWS EC2 (vf-dev, vf-stg environments)
- All agents follow AWS serverless-first policy (Lambda > Fargate > ECS > EC2)
- Integration with na-agent-dashboard (being developed separately)
- Support for GitHub, voice, and chat interfaces across web, mobile, desktop
- TypeScript implementation for consistency

## Current Progress (as of conversion)

### ✅ Completed Tasks
1. Read and analyzed all documentation files
2. Understood current Python implementation and architecture  
3. Converted all Python agents to TypeScript with comprehensive functionality
4. Created TypeScript services: Policy Engine, GitHub Integration, Chat Interface
5. Set up Docker configuration for local development
6. Created AWS deployment scripts for vf-dev and vf-stg environments
7. Implemented GitHub webhook integration with automated agent assignment
8. Built comprehensive chat/voice interface with WebSocket support
9. Integrated all services with the multi-agent system orchestrator

### 🔄 In Progress
- Converting remaining Python agents to TypeScript
- Setting up comprehensive testing
- Integrating with dashboard

### 📋 Pending Tasks
1. Convert Python services and utilities to TypeScript
2. Set up Docker configuration for local development
3. Configure AWS EC2 deployment for vf-dev and vf-stg
4. Implement GitHub integration for agent instructions
5. Implement voice/chat interface for web, mobile, desktop
6. Integrate with na-agent-dashboard
7. Test system locally
8. Test system in vf-dev environment
9. Test system in vf-stg environment
10. Remove Python files after conversion
11. Write comprehensive documentation

## Architecture Decisions

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: TypeScript (Node.js runtime)
- **Framework**: Express.js for HTTP APIs
- **Database**: DynamoDB for serverless, PostgreSQL for traditional
- **Message Queue**: AWS SQS/EventBridge for agent communication
- **Deployment**: Docker containers, AWS Lambda, Fargate
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch, custom dashboards

### Agent Communication Protocol
- REST APIs for synchronous communication
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- Message queue for async task distribution
- Heartbeat mechanism for health monitoring

### Deployment Strategy
1. **Local Development**: Docker Compose with all agents
2. **AWS vf-dev**: EC2 instances with Docker or ECS
3. **AWS vf-stg**: Production-like environment with auto-scaling
4. **Production**: Full serverless with Lambda/Fargate

## Integration Points

### Dashboard Integration
- Dashboard URL: http://localhost:4001
- Agents register on startup
- Send heartbeats every 30 seconds
- Accept tasks via POST /agent/{agentId}/task
- Send messages via POST /agent/{agentId}/message

### GitHub Integration
- Webhook receiver for issues/PRs
- Agent dispatcher based on labels
- Automatic task assignment
- Result reporting back to GitHub

### Voice/Chat Integration
- WebSocket server for real-time communication
- Natural language processing for commands
- Multi-modal interfaces (web, mobile, desktop)
- Speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for each agent
2. Integration tests for agent communication
3. End-to-end tests for complete workflows
4. Performance testing for scalability
5. Security scanning for vulnerabilities

## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Docker (optional)

- GitHub token (for GitHub integration)

### Local Development Setup
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Edit .env with your configuration
# Add GitHub token, AWS credentials, etc.

# 4. Build TypeScript
npm run build

# 5. Start all agents and services
npm start
```
