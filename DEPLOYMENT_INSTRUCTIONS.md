# 🚀 NA-Agents Deployment Instructions

## 🎯 **System Status: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**

✅ **Complete TypeScript conversion finished**  
✅ **GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline configured**  
✅ **AWS deployment automation ready**  
✅ **All code committed and ready to push**

---

## 📋 **Immediate Next Steps**

### 1. **Configure GitHub Repository Secrets**
Go to: https://github.com/NiroAgent/na-agents/settings/secrets/actions

**Add these secrets:**
```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID          # From your Windows AWS profile
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY      # From your Windows AWS profile
```

**Add this variable:**
```bash
AWS_ACCOUNT_ID             # Your AWS account ID
```

### 2. **Trigger Deployment**
```bash
# Navigate to the repository
cd /home/ssurles/Projects/NiroAgent/NiroAgent/na-agents

# Push to trigger GitHub Actions
git push origin master
```

### 3. **Monitor Deployment**
- **GitHub Actions**: https://github.com/NiroAgent/na-agents/actions
- **First deployment** will automatically go to **vf-dev**
- **Manual approval** required for **vf-stg**

## 🔍 **What Happens When You Push**

### **Automatic Pipeline Execution:**

#### **Phase 1: Testing & Quality (3-5 minutes)**
- ✅ TypeScript compilation and type checking
- ✅ ESLint code quality analysis
- ✅ Unit tests with PostgreSQL and Redis
- ✅ Security scanning (npm audit, Semgrep, Trivy)
- ✅ Docker image build and security scan

#### **Phase 2: vf-dev Deployment (5-10 minutes)**
- ✅ Docker image push to ECR
- ✅ CloudFormation stack deployment
- ✅ ECS service deployment with health checks
- ✅ Smoke tests on all 5 agents
- ✅ Load balancer and networking setup

#### **Phase 3: vf-stg Deployment (Manual Approval)**
- ⏸️ **Requires manual approval** in GitHub Actions UI
- ✅ Comprehensive integration testing
- ✅ Performance validation
- ✅ Full system verification

## 🌐 **Expected Endpoints After Deployment**

### **vf-dev Environment**
```bash
# Auto-detected load balancer URL (example)
http://na-agents-alb-vf-dev-123456789.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com

# Agent endpoints:
:5001  # Architect Agent
:5002  # Developer Agent  
:5003  # DevOps Agent
:5004  # QA Agent
:5005  # Manager Agent
:7000  # Chat Interface
:6000  # GitHub Webhook Service
```

### **Verification Commands**
```bash
# Run our verification script
./scripts/verify-deployment.sh vf-dev

# Manual health checks
curl http://[load-balancer]:5001/health  # Architect
curl http://[load-balancer]:5002/health  # Developer
curl http://[load-balancer]:5003/health  # DevOps
curl http://[load-balancer]:5004/health  # QA
curl http://[load-balancer]:5005/health  # Manager
```

## 🛡️ **Security & Compliance**

### **Automatic Security Scanning**
- ✅ Container vulnerability scanning with Trivy
- ✅ Dependency vulnerability checking
- ✅ Static code analysis with Semgrep
- ✅ SARIF results uploaded to GitHub Security tab

### **AWS Security**
- ✅ IAM roles with least privilege
- ✅ VPC with private subnets
- ✅ Security groups with minimal access
- ✅ Encrypted data at rest and in transit

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **If GitHub Actions Fail:**

1. **Check Secrets**: Ensure AWS secrets are properly configured
2. **Check Permissions**: Verify AWS user has ECR and CloudFormation permissions
3. **Check Logs**: View detailed logs in GitHub Actions UI
4. **Manual Override**: Use force_deploy flag if needed

### **Common Issues:**

#### **AWS Credentials Error**
```bash
# Error: "Unable to locate credentials"
# Solution: Verify AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY in GitHub secrets
```

#### **ECR Push Failed**
```bash
# Error: "no basic auth credentials"
# Solution: Check AWS account ID variable and ECR permissions
```

#### **Health Check Timeout**
```bash
# Error: "Health check failed"
# Solution: Wait longer for services to start, check CloudFormation events
```

### **Emergency Commands**
```bash
# Force deployment (bypass tests)
gh workflow run deploy.yml -f environment=vf-dev -f force_deploy=true

# Rollback to previous version
aws ecs update-service --cluster na-agents-vf-dev --service architect-service-vf-dev --force-new-deployment

# Check CloudFormation stack
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name na-agents-vf-dev
```

## 📊 **Deployment Success Indicators**

### **You'll know deployment succeeded when:**
1. ✅ All GitHub Actions jobs show green checkmarks
2. ✅ ECR shows new Docker images with current commit SHA
3. ✅ CloudFormation stack shows "UPDATE_COMPLETE" or "CREATE_COMPLETE"
4. ✅ Load balancer health checks are passing
5. ✅ All agent endpoints respond with 200 status
6. ✅ Chat interface is accessible and functional

### **Expected Timeline:**
- **Total deployment time**: 15-20 minutes
- **Testing phase**: 3-5 minutes
- **Docker build**: 5-8 minutes  
- **AWS deployment**: 7-12 minutes

---

## 🎉 **Post-Deployment Actions**

### **Once vf-dev is successful:**

1. **Test the chat interface**: Visit `http://[load-balancer]:7000`
2. **Test GitHub integration**: Create a test issue with labels
3. **Verify agent communication**: Use the chat UI to send tasks
4. **Approve vf-stg deployment**: Go to GitHub Actions → Environments → vf-stg → Review deployments

### **Integration with Dashboard**
- The **na-agent-dashboard** (being developed separately) will connect to these agent endpoints
- Agents are configured to register with dashboard at startup
- Health monitoring and metrics are exposed via standard endpoints

## 🔄 **Continuous Deployment**

### **Future Deployments:**
- **Push to main/develop** → **Automatic vf-dev deployment**
- **Manual approval** → **vf-stg deployment**
- **Git tag (v1.0.0)** → **Production release**

### **Monitoring:**
- **GitHub Actions**: Real-time deployment status
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Infrastructure and application metrics
- **Chat Interface**: Direct agent interaction and testing

## 🆘 **Need Help?**

If deployment fails or you encounter issues:

1. **Check GitHub Actions logs** for detailed error messages
2. **Run verification script**: `./scripts/verify-deployment.sh vf-dev`
3. **Check AWS CloudFormation** events in AWS Console
4. **Review agent logs** via CloudWatch or local files

The system is designed for reliable, automated deployment with comprehensive error handling and rollback capabilities.

**🎊 Ready to deploy! Just push to GitHub and watch the magic happen! 🚀**
